# ender3profiles
A repository of Cura profiles for the Creality Ender 3 3D printer. They are tested to work on an Ender 3 Pro.

The parameters in the profile named 'ender3_rep2.curaprofile' were chosen to yield fast, decent quality prints. As you can guess from the name some of the settings I use were inspired by some of the settings I have used with a rep2 that we use in my lab.

The parameters in the profile named 'ender3_sj.curaprofile' is a lightly modified version of the stock profile that comes with Cura 4.2.1. I've included it here for anybody interested but it shouldn't give drastically better results than what the stock Cura profile provides.
